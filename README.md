# Data Structures and Algorithms

See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.

## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `javascript` folder, at the top level, is a sub-folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

If you have not already done so, run `npm install` from within this folder to setup your system to be able to run tests using `Jest`

To run your tests

- Change to the `javascript` folder
- run `npm test` to run all of the tests
- run `npm test ##` to only run tests for challenge ## (i.e. 01)

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

- Please follow the instructions specific to your 401 language, which can be found in the directory below, matching your course.

### Reverse an Array

- Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

# Insert to Middle of an Array
Take a single value and insert it into the middle of an existing array

# Binary Search of Sorted Array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

# Linked List Insertions

### append

arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

### insert before

arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

### insert after

arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

This is the most efficient approach I could take without using built in methods
